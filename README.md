# iamrobin.ai — Website v2 / Zen Loop

A static-first Astro website that turns the I AM ROBIN mnemonic into a quiet
identity cycle: nucleus, growth, sakura drift, and return.

The public site is deployed as the Cloudflare Worker `robin-web`. Cloudflare
Workers Builds watches the GitHub `main` branch and performs the production
build and deployment.

## Local preview

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Validation

```sh
pnpm run release:check
pnpm audit --prod
```

The release check validates Astro/TypeScript, builds all routes, and inspects
canonical URLs, robots directives, Open Graph/Twitter metadata, JSON-LD,
sitemaps, internal links, and edge files.

## BTC Probability Atlas

The public Atlas is at
<https://iamrobin.ai/resonance/btc_probability_atlas/>. English is the default;
its page-level language menu also supports Simplified Chinese, Traditional
Chinese and Japanese. The forecast algorithm runs locally each day, while the
public page remains a reviewed frozen snapshot and does not automatically publish
daily outputs. See `docs/btc-probability-atlas.md` for the release boundary and
verification map.
